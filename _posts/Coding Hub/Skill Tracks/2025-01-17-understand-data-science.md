#### Supervised Learning (Labeled Data)
* **Classification (Predicting Categories)** → Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes
    * Used for spam detection, fraud detection, etc.
* **Regression (Predicting Numbers)** → Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
    * Used for sales forecasting, house price prediction, etc.

#### Unsupervised Learning (No Labeled Data)
* **Clustering (Grouping Similar Data)** → k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering  
    * Used for customer segmentation, document clustering, pattern recognition, etc.
* **Similarity Matching (Finding Similar Items)** → k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  
    * Used for recommendation systems, image recognition, etc.
* **Co-occurrence Grouping (Finding Items Bought Together)** → Association Rule Mining (Apriori)  
    * Used for market basket analysis, e.g., “People who buy bread also buy butter.”
* **Data Reduction (Simplifying Data)** → Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
    * Used for reducing features while keeping important information, e.g., image compression.

#### Graph-based Learning
* **Link Prediction (Finding Connections in Networks)** → PageRank  
    * Used for search engine ranking, recommendation systems, e.g., “People You May Know”

#### Causal Inference (Cause & Effect)
* **Causal Modeling (Understanding Impact of Changes)** → A/B Testing  
    * Used for product experiments, marketing campaigns, e.g., “Does changing the button color increase clicks?”
